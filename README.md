# Welfare-Application-JTPA
This repository contains R files to calculate the welfare difference between different job training program eligibility criteria, using experimental data from the National Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Study. These files can be used to replicate the Empirical Application Section in "Identification and Inference for Welfare Gains without Unconfoundedness".
